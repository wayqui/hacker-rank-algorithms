# HackerRank solutions

This project contains several of my implementations of different problems proposed by HackerRank people. I'll be including here different algorithms and my solutions with tests and so on. Also I'll include the links of the algorithms in HackerRank page.

* Divisible Sum Pairs (DivisibleSumPairsTest.java): [https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/divisible-sum-pairs/problem]
* Migratory Birds (MigratoryBirdsTest): [https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/migratory-birds/]
